The following exercises challenge you to learn more about Date and Time:

1. Consider the following code fragment:

   System.out.printf("Now = %s%n", Instant.now());
   System.out.printf("Now = %s%n", LocalDateTime.now());

   When I executed this code fragment in my America/Chicago default time zone around 2:18PM on March 24, 2013, I observed the 
   following output:

   Now = 2013-03-24T19:18:33.355Z
   Now = 2013-03-24T14:18:33.480

   Why does the first line show 7:18:33PM when it's 2:18:33PM in my America/Chicago time zone?

2. What is a partial? Identify java.time's classes that represent partials.

3. What is a period?

4. What is a clock? 

5. How would you obtain a LocalDateTime that always uses the same instant on the time-line (for testing purposes)?

6. Write a FrenchMonthNames application that uses Date and Time to obtain the 12 month names in French and output these 
   names. For example, output janvier for January.

7. I've created a ShowCalPage application (see the ShowCalPage directory in the exercises directory) that outputs calendar 
   pages in the US or FRANCE locale. Here are examples for the same month:

   March 2013
   Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa 
                   1  2
    3  4  5  6  7  8  9
   10 11 12 13 14 15 16
   17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   24 25 26 27 28 29 30
   31 

   mars 2013
   di lu ma me je ve sa 
                   1  2
    3  4  5  6  7  8  9
   10 11 12 13 14 15 16
   17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   24 25 26 27 28 29 30
   31 

   Rewrite this application so that it no longer requires the java.util package's Calendar, Iterator, Map, and Set types.
   Instead, it should only require java.time's DayOfWeek, LocalDate, Month and java.time.format's TextStyle types. (Of 
   course, you'll still need to use java.util.Locale.)

each exercise your best shot before checking the answer.
